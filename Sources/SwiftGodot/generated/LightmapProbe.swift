/// Represents a single manually placed probe for dynamic object lighting with ``LightmapGI``.
/// 
/// ``LightmapProbe`` represents the position of a single manually placed probe for dynamic object lighting with ``LightmapGI``. Lightmap probes affect the lighting of ``GeometryInstance3D``-derived nodes that have their ``GeometryInstance3D/giMode`` set to ``GeometryInstance3D/GIMode/dynamic``.
/// 
/// Typically, ``LightmapGI`` probes are placed automatically by setting ``LightmapGI/generateProbesSubdiv`` to a value other than ``LightmapGI/GenerateProbes/disabled``. By creating ``LightmapProbe`` nodes before baking lightmaps, you can add more probes in specific areas for greater detail, or disable automatic generation and rely only on manually placed probes instead.
/// 
/// > Note: ``LightmapProbe`` nodes that are placed after baking lightmaps are ignored by dynamic objects. You must bake lightmaps again after creating or modifying ``LightmapProbe``s for the probes to be effective.
///
