/// One-shot timer.
/// 
/// A one-shot timer managed by the scene tree, which emits [signal timeout] on completion. See also ``SceneTree/createTimer(timeSec:processAlways:processInPhysics:ignoreTimeScale:)``.
/// 
/// As opposed to ``Timer``, it does not require the instantiation of a node. Commonly used to create a one-shot delay timer as in the following example:
/// 
/// The timer will be dereferenced after its time elapses. To preserve the timer, you can keep a reference to it. See ``RefCounted``.
/// 
/// > Note: The timer is processed after all of the nodes in the current frame, i.e. node's ``Node/_process(delta:)`` method would be called before the timer (or ``Node/_physicsProcess(delta:)`` if `process_in_physics` in ``SceneTree/createTimer(timeSec:processAlways:processInPhysics:ignoreTimeScale:)`` has been set to `true`).
/// 
/// 
/// 
/// This object emits the following signals:
/// 
/// - ``timeout``
