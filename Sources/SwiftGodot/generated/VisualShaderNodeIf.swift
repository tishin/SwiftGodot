/// Outputs a 3D vector based on the result of a floating-point comparison within the visual shader graph.
/// 
/// This visual shader node has six input ports:
/// 
/// - Port **1** and **2** provide the two floating-point numbers `a` and `b` that will be compared.
/// 
/// - Port **3** is the tolerance, which allows similar floating-point numbers to be considered equal.
/// 
/// - Ports **4**, **5**, and **6** are the possible outputs, returned if `a == b`, `a > b`, or `a < b` respectively.
